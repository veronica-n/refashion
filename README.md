# re fashion
Re fashion is an ios/android app that aims to educate users on fashion brands, promote sustainable options for buying and discarding clothes and assist in wardrobe organization. In the app, users can add and categorize items in their closet. Scores are given to each closet item, depending on the brand and how the item was obtained. The user's overall closet is given a score to show their progress towards a greener wardrobe. Within the app, users also have the option to explore different brands, learn about their closet ratings and learn about local places to shop sustainably, clothing donation centers and platforms where they can resell clothing.

Our algorithm desgin was inspired by information from https://goodonyou.eco/ and the 2020 Fashion Transparency Index (https://issuu.com/fashionrevolution/docs/fr_fashiontransparencyindex2020?fr=sNmI5NzYxMDk0OA)  

In the future, we hope to implement and test the photo feature and expand our database to support more clothing brands and to have more information on shopping and donating. With more time, we hope to make our interface more streamlined and improve our algorithmâ€™s efficiency.
